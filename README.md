Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

-- models directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
- tests directory will contain all unit tests.
- console.py file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
- models/base_model.py file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
	- attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
	- methods: save() and to_json()
- models/engine directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: file_storage.py.
